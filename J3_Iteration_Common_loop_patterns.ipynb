    "# Common Loop Patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "When we use loops, there are often a set of common patterns that we use. For example, we may go through all the elements of a list and find the items with the highest value. Or do something with every element of the list, and store the result in another.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below, we will discuss a few of these common patterns. Most of these patterns have the following structure:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Initialize one or more variables before the loop starts\n",
    "* Perform some computation on each item in the loop body, possibly changing the variables in the body of the loop\n",
    "* Look at the resulting variables when the loop completes"
